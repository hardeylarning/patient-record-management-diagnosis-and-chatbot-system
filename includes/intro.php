    Hospitals are supposed to be an essential part of our lives which provides us with the best medical facilities for
    various sickness, concerned management of the hospital is concerned with the increasing effort in attending to
    patients. Health is generally said to be wealth, and good health is a necessity for all. It takes healthy people
    to generate the wealth the nation requires for the general well-being of its people. It is also a known fact that
    the production of qualified medical doctors and other medical personnel and consultants is on the increase,
    but this is not enough to meet the health needs of the increasing population.
    The ratio of patients to a doctor is still high. This situation creates problems, because proper and adequate
    medical attention of patients is far-fetched. Nowadays, the low-income class is mostly affected. Doctors hurry over
    their duties in order to attend to all the patients. At the end of the day, they are tired and over worked.
    The patients queue up for several hours from one unit of the hospital to another starting from obtaining a new
    hospital folder, or retrieving an old one before consulting a doctor, to the laboratory unit for lab test then to
    the pharmacy to get the prescribed drugs and so on. With the manual processes involved in handling the patient most
    of them waste the whole day in the hospital. Very often, patients leave their homes very early in the morning in
    order to be among the first group to see the doctor. Otherwise, they may end up wasting the whole day without due
    attention. As a result of difficulties faced at hospitals, most people now choose to self-medicate, buying drugs at
    pharmacies without prescription. Many also opt for traditional treatments in the form of herbal teas and concoctions.
    These options may create public health catastrophes on their own, including poisoning from herbal remedies and
    complications that may arise from taking medications not prescribed by doctors.
